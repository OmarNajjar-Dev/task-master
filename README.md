# Task Master

**Task Master** is a bilingual (English/Arabic), responsive to-do list web app for managing daily tasks with speed and simplicity. It runs entirely in the browser — no sign-up, no backend — and saves your tasks using `localStorage` in JSON format.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Task Master combines clean design with practical features like dark mode, filtering, and real-time search.
